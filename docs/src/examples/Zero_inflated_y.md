# Strategies for zero inflated y 

**Options available in HTBoost for zero-inflated data.**

HTBoost has three loss functions for zero inflated data:
    ```:hurdleGamma, :hurdleL2, :hurdleL2loglink```
The :hurdleGamma is closest to the Tweedie distribution in LightGBM, XGB, and CatBoost.
Hurdle models in HTBoost build two separate models, one with logistic loss to predict
the occurence of a zero, and a second model with loss gamma or L2 or L2loglink to predict
y|y≠0. Compared to a Tweedie regression, hurdle models have richer parametrization but
far weaker constraints on the process, implying higher variance and smaller bias.
My reading of the literature is that hurdle model typically outperform Tweedy in terms of
forecasting. 

While :hurdleGamma and :hurdleL2loglink require y≥0, a :hurdleL2 loss can be used if
some y are negative. A hurdleL2 loss could therefore also be used if an otherwise continuous
y has positive mass at some value v other than zero, by working with y-v. 

A hurdleL2loglink loss can be a strong alternative to a hurdleGamma loss, if the gamma
assumption is incorrect.

A hurdleL2loglink is also an option for zero-inflated count data, as an alternative to
a Poisson or GammaPoisson. 

**What this script does.** 

- Generates data from a gamma distribution, which is then transformed to produce excess zeros. 
- Fit HTBoost, with loss = :hurdleGamma or :hurdleL2loglink
- A comparison with LightGBM using the Tweedie loss is promising.
- HTBpredict takes the form:
    yf,prob0,yf_not0     = HTBpredict(x_test,output) 
where yf = E(y|x) = (1-prob0)*yf_not0
